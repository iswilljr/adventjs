# Challenge #23: 🔢 Find the missing numbers

The elves are preparing the gifts 🎁 for Christmas, but they have realized that some numbers are missing in their sequence.

You are given an array of integers that should contain all the numbers from 1 to the maximum number found in the array. However, some numbers are missing.

Your task is to write a function that receives the array and returns a new array with all the missing numbers, in ascending order.

```javascript
getMissingNumbers([4, 8, 7, 2])
// [1, 3, 5, 6]

getMissingNumbers([3, 2, 4, 1])
// []

getMissingNumbers([5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 2, 1])
// [4]

getMissingNumbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
// []
```
